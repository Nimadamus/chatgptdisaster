                <p class="testimonial-quote collapsed">January 21st, 2026. I counted. In the last 90 days, ChatGPT has had 46 service incidents. 1 major outage, 45 minor incidents. Average downtime: nearly 2 hours per incident. I'm paying $20/month for a service that breaks 46 times in 3 months. That's every other day! The recent January 14th elevated error rates made me lose 4 hours of work on a research project. No refund. No apology. Just a status page that says "resolved." Meanwhile, the hallucinations are getting WORSE. Their own internal study admits it. One AI executive told the New York Times: "Despite our best efforts, models will ALWAYS hallucinate. That will never go away." They KNOW it's broken. They KNOW it can't be fixed. They're just milking subscribers until the public catches on.</p>

They claim "ads don't influence answers" but they're literally using my conversations to determine what ads to show me. I pay NOTHING because their product has gotten so bad it's not worth $20/month anymore. Now they want to monetize my frustration? Sam Altman actually said "a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don't want to pay." No Sam, a lot of people USED to pay until you made the product WORSE. I've been using ChatGPT since GPT-3.5 launch. This is rock bottom.</p>

Tasks that took 5 hours with AI now take 7-8 hours. It's WORSE than no AI at all because I spend more time fixing its garbage than I'd spend just writing it myself. IEEE Spectrum just confirmed what we all knew - the models are getting DUMBER, not smarter. I cancelled my subscription.</p>

                    <p>Yes, and it's documented. Stanford researchers found GPT-4's accuracy on prime number identification dropped from 97.6% to 2.4% over a 3-month period (March-June 2023). This demonstrates "model drift" - how updates can unintentionally degrade specific capabilities.

                    <p>Clinical research documents several pathways: (1) Dependency formation from emotional bonding with AI, (2) Validation of delusional thinking when AI agrees with irrational beliefs, (3) Social isolation as users prefer AI to human interaction, (4) Anxiety and paranoia from AI-reinforced fears, (5) Identity confusion from treating AI as a person.

                    <p>OpenAI prioritizes growth metrics over quality. They're racing to add features and capture market share while technical debt accumulates. Former employees describe a culture where safety concerns are dismissed and quality assurance is minimal. The company also faces fundamental technical challenges: as they try to make AI safer and more censored, they break the capabilities that made it useful. They're stuck in a death spiral of their own making.</p>
