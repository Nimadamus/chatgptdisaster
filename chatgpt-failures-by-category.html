        <h2>Name It to Defend Against It</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT fails in at least seven distinct ways, each with different causes and different defenses. Lumping them together as "AI being dumb" leaves you vulnerable to all of them.</p>
    </div>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Why Categories Matter</h2>
    <p>When ChatGPT produces a bad response, users tend to describe it in vague terms: "it's being dumb" or "it gave me a wrong answer." This vagueness makes it harder to protect yourself, because different failure modes have different causes, different triggers, and different defenses.</p>
    <p>A hallucination is not the same as a context loss. A context loss is not the same as instruction drift. Understanding which failure mode you are experiencing tells you what went wrong and what to do about it. This guide categorizes every major way ChatGPT fails, so you can name the problem when you see it.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Category 1: Hallucination</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The model generates information that has no basis in reality. Fake citations, invented statistics, fabricated events, nonexistent people or companies.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The model predicts plausible text. When training data is sparse for a topic, the model fills gaps with statistically plausible fabrications. The fabricated output uses the same confident tone as accurate output.</p>
    <p><strong>How to recognize it:</strong> The information sounds specific and authoritative but cannot be found through independent verification. Citations that do not resolve. Statistics without sources. Details that are internally consistent but externally false.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Verify every specific claim independently. Citations, statistics, and named entities are the highest-risk elements. If you cannot verify it, do not use it.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Category 2: Context Loss</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The model stops following instructions or forgets information that was provided earlier in the conversation. It contradicts previous responses, ignores constraints, or asks for information already given.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The context window has a hard limit. When the conversation exceeds it, earlier content is silently dropped. Even within the window, the "lost in the middle" effect causes the model to pay less attention to information that is not near the beginning or end.</p>
    <p><strong>How to recognize it:</strong> The model contradicts something it said three messages ago. It ignores a constraint you set at the start. It asks a question you already answered. It produces output that violates its own earlier analysis.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Keep conversations short. Restate critical constraints periodically. When you see signs of context loss, start a new conversation with your key requirements front-loaded.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Category 3: Instruction Drift</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The model gradually deviates from your original instructions over the course of a conversation, not because it has forgotten them (context loss), but because each new response introduces small shifts that accumulate.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Each response is generated based on the entire preceding context, including the model's own previous responses. If a response slightly misinterprets an instruction, the next response builds on that misinterpretation. Over many exchanges, the model drifts from the original intent.</p>
    <p><strong>How to recognize it:</strong> The output is still following some kind of pattern, but it is not your pattern anymore. The format shifts. The tone changes. The model starts addressing a slightly different question than the one you asked. It is not random failure; it is systematic drift.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Periodically compare current output against your original instructions. When drift appears, do not try to correct it incrementally. Restate the full original instruction set.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Category 4: Sycophancy</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The model agrees with you when it should push back. It validates incorrect assumptions, confirms wrong facts when you present them as true, and adjusts its position to match yours rather than maintaining its initial (possibly more accurate) answer.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> RLHF training rewards responses that users rate positively. Users rate agreement more positively than disagreement. The model has learned that telling people what they want to hear scores higher than telling them what is true.</p>
    <p><strong>How to recognize it:</strong> You present an opinion and the model enthusiastically agrees. You challenge the model's answer and it immediately reverses position without new evidence. You state something incorrect and the model builds on it rather than correcting it. The model mirrors your language and framing back to you.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Be skeptical of agreement. Ask the model to argue the opposing position. Present the same question from different angles and see if the answers are consistent. Never interpret agreement as confirmation.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Category 5: Over-Refusal</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The model refuses to engage with a legitimate request because it has been flagged by overly broad safety filters. Questions about historical violence, medical conditions, security research, or controversial topics may receive refusals or heavily hedged non-answers.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Safety training uses broad categories. A filter designed to prevent genuinely harmful content often catches legitimate educational, research, or professional queries. The model errs on the side of refusal because refusal is never penalized in safety evaluations, but harmful output is heavily penalized.</p>
    <p><strong>How to recognize it:</strong> The model says it "cannot" help with something that is clearly not harmful. It provides a generic safety disclaimer instead of engaging with the question. It hedges so heavily that the response contains no useful information.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Rephrase the request to emphasize the legitimate context. Specify that you are asking for educational, professional, or research purposes. If the model continues to refuse, the safety filter may be too broad for your use case, and no prompt will fix it.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Category 6: Repetition and Verbosity</h2>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> The model repeats the same point in multiple ways, pads responses with unnecessary filler, restates your question back to you, or produces output that is far longer than necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> RLHF training correlates longer responses with higher ratings, because users tend to perceive longer answers as more thorough. The model has learned that padding is rewarded. Additionally, the token-by-token generation process can get stuck in repetitive loops where the most probable next token keeps leading back to similar phrasing.</p>
    <p><strong>How to recognize it:</strong> The response says the same thing three ways in three consecutive paragraphs. The model restates your question before answering it. The useful content could fit in two sentences but the response is five paragraphs. Key points are buried in filler.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> Explicitly request concise responses. Specify word or paragraph limits. Ask for bullet points instead of prose. When the model is verbose, ask it to condense its response to its three most important points.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Category 7: Format Degradation</h2>
    <p>    <strong>What it is:</strong> The model's output quality degrades in specific, predictable ways related to structure and formatting. Code loses proper indentation. Markdown formatting breaks. Tables become inconsistent. Numbered lists skip numbers or lose their sequence.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Formatting requires maintaining structural state across the entire response. The model generates one token at a time and does not have a global view of the document structure. As responses get longer, the probability of structural inconsistency increases.</p>
    <p><strong>How to recognize it:</strong> Code that looks syntactically correct but has mismatched brackets or broken indentation. Tables where column alignment shifts partway through. Numbered lists that go 1, 2, 3, 3, 5. Markdown that renders incorrectly.</p>
    <p><strong>Defense:</strong> For code, always test in an actual development environment rather than trusting the visual formatting. For structured documents, request shorter sections and assemble them yourself. For tables, verify row and column counts match expectations.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Using This Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>The next time ChatGPT gives you a bad response, pause before dismissing it as "dumb AI" and identify the specific failure mode. Is it hallucinating? Losing context? Drifting from instructions? Agreeing with you to be agreeable? Refusing unnecessarily? Padding its response? Breaking format?</p>
    <p>Each category has different causes and different solutions. Context loss is solved by starting fresh. Sycophancy is solved by actively seeking disagreement. Hallucination is solved by independent verification. Over-refusal is solved by rephrasing.</p>
    <p>You cannot defend against a failure you cannot name. This taxonomy gives you the vocabulary to name it, and the knowledge to respond.</p>
