        <h2>The Core Truth</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT does not fail because of bugs. It fails because of what it fundamentally is, and what it fundamentally is not. Every failure traces back to architecture, not implementation.</p>
    </div>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Core Problem: Language Models Don't Understand Anything</h2>
    <p>Here is the single most important thing to understand about ChatGPT: it does not know what words mean.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT is a next-token prediction engine. Given a sequence of text, it predicts the most statistically likely next word. It does this billions of times per second, stringing together predictions that form grammatically correct, contextually plausible sentences. The result looks like understanding. It sounds like understanding. But it is not understanding.</p>
    <p>This is not a philosophical distinction. It has direct, practical consequences for every interaction you have with the tool. When ChatGPT tells you that a Supreme Court case supports your legal argument, it is not evaluating legal precedent. It is generating text that looks like what a helpful legal assistant would say. When it writes code that compiles but silently corrupts your database, it is not reasoning about data integrity. It is producing code that resembles working code from its training data.</p>
    <p>The gap between "sounds right" and "is right" is where every failure lives.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>It Makes Things Up and Doesn't Know It's Doing It</h2>
    <p>Hallucination is the polite term the AI industry uses for a simple reality: ChatGPT fabricates information and presents it as fact. It invents research papers with real-sounding titles and fake DOIs. It cites court cases that don't exist. It attributes quotes to people who never said them. And it does all of this with the same tone and confidence it uses when telling you something true.</p>
    <p>This is not a bug that OpenAI is working to fix. Hallucination is an inherent property of how generative language models work. The model's job is to produce plausible text. "Plausible" and "true" are not the same thing, and the model has no internal mechanism for distinguishing between them.</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>It Forgets What You Just Said</h2>
    <p>Every ChatGPT conversation has a hard limit on how much text the model can process at once. This is called the context window. When your conversation exceeds it, the model silently drops earlier parts and continues responding as if nothing happened. It contradicts instructions you gave five messages ago. It forgets constraints you set at the beginning. It repeats work it already did.</p>
    <p>Users experience this as the model "getting dumber" during long conversations. It is not getting dumber. It is losing its memory. And because the model has no awareness of what it has lost, it fills in the gaps with plausible-sounding output that may have nothing to do with your actual conversation.</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>It Gives Wrong Answers for Structural Reasons</h2>
    <p>When ChatGPT gives you a wrong answer, it is not because it made a mistake in the way a human makes a mistake. The model's objective function is to predict plausible next tokens. "Plausible" is determined by statistical patterns in training data. If the training data contains more examples of a particular claim than its correction, the model will favor the more common, and potentially wrong, version.</p>
    <p>This is why ChatGPT can ace a standardized test one day and fail basic arithmetic the next. The test questions closely resemble training data. The arithmetic problem requires genuine computation that the model can only approximate through pattern matching.</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Confidence Problem</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most dangerous failure mode is not that ChatGPT gets things wrong, but that it gets things wrong with absolute confidence. There is no uncertainty indicator. No "I'm not sure about this" qualifier that correlates with actual reliability. The model uses the same authoritative tone whether it is telling you the boiling point of water or inventing a medical diagnosis.</p>
    <p>Users who don't understand this treat ChatGPT's confident tone as a signal of reliability. They trust wrong answers because those answers sound right. This has led to lawyers submitting fabricated case citations to courts, students turning in papers with invented sources, and businesses making decisions based on fictional data.</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Training Data Is the Ceiling</h2>
    <p>Everything ChatGPT knows comes from its training data, a snapshot of the internet frozen at a specific point in time. The data has a cutoff date, but the model won't tell you that. The training data itself is flawed, full of misinformation, bias, and contradictions. And as more AI-generated content floods the internet, future models will increasingly be trained on output from previous models, a degradation cycle researchers call "model collapse."</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Models Get Worse, Not Better</h2>
    <p>If you have been using ChatGPT since 2023, you have probably noticed something that OpenAI denies: it has gotten worse. Responses are shorter. Analysis is shallower. The model refuses more requests. Research from Stanford and UC Berkeley confirmed measurable performance declines between GPT-4 versions released just months apart. The reasons are structural: safety filtering, RLHF drift, and cost optimization.</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Hard Limits That Scaling Won't Fix</h2>
    <p>There are things large language models fundamentally cannot do: reliable multi-step reasoning, precise mathematics, real-time information access, output self-verification, causal understanding, and planning. These are not engineering problems waiting for a solution. They are consequences of the architecture.</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Failure Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>Not all ChatGPT failures are the same. Hallucination is different from context loss. Context loss is different from instruction drift. Instruction drift is different from sycophancy. Understanding the categories helps you recognize them when they happen, rather than blaming yourself for "prompting wrong."</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>When Not to Trust It</h2>
    <p>The practical question becomes: when is it safe to rely on ChatGPT, and when is it dangerous? The answer depends on the stakes, the verifiability of the output, and whether you have the expertise to catch errors. ChatGPT is a useful brainstorming tool. It is a dangerous research tool. The line between them is not about the model's capability. It is about your ability to verify what it tells you.</p>

</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT is not a broken product. It is a product that works exactly as designed, and the design has fundamental limitations that its marketing deliberately obscures.</p>
    <p>Every failure documented on this site, every hallucination, every forgotten conversation, every confidently wrong answer, traces back to the structural realities outlined in this guide. The model does not understand language. It predicts it. It does not know facts. It generates text that resembles facts. It does not reason. It pattern-matches.</p>
    <p>Once you understand this, you stop being surprised by the failures. You start expecting them. And you start using the tool for what it actually is, rather than what OpenAI wants you to believe it is.</p>
    <p>That is not pessimism. That is literacy.</p>
