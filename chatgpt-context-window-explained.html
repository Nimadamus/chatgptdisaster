        <h2>The Core Problem</h2>
        <p>ChatGPT does not remember your conversation. It re-reads it every time. When the text exceeds its context window, information silently disappears, and the model fills gaps with plausible fiction.</p>
    </div>

<section class="section">
    <h2>What a Context Window Actually Is</h2>
    <p>Every time you send a message to ChatGPT, the model does not just read your latest message. It reads the entire conversation from the beginning, processes it, and generates a response. The context window is the maximum amount of text it can process at once.</p>
    <p>Think of it as the model's working memory. Everything inside the window is visible. Everything outside the window does not exist.</p>
    <p>For GPT-4, the standard context window is roughly 8,000 tokens (about 6,000 words). Extended versions support 128,000 tokens. A token is not a word. It is a chunk of text, sometimes a full word, sometimes part of one, sometimes punctuation. The word "understanding" is two tokens. Code is far more token-dense than plain English.</p>
    <p>And here is the part that matters: every message in the conversation, yours and ChatGPT's, counts against the limit. The model's own responses eat into the context window. The longer its answers, the less room there is for your instructions. The conversation is slowly consuming itself.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>What Happens When You Hit the Limit</h2>
    <p>When the conversation exceeds the context window, the model does not tell you. There is no warning. No indicator. No error message. The model simply stops seeing the older parts of the conversation and continues responding as if it has full context.</p>
    <p>The result is a form of silent failure that is worse than an outright crash. A crash tells you something went wrong. Silent context loss tells you nothing. The model keeps producing fluent, confident output, but that output is now disconnected from the instructions and context that were supposed to govern it.</p>
    <p>This is why users report that ChatGPT "gets dumber" during long conversations. It is not getting dumber. It is going blind.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The "Lost in the Middle" Problem</h2>
    <p>Even when your conversation fits within the context window, there is a second problem. Research from Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Samaya AI demonstrated that large language models pay disproportionate attention to the beginning and end of their context window, while largely ignoring information in the middle.</p>
    <p>Performance was strong when relevant information appeared in the first or last few paragraphs. When key information was placed in the middle of a long document, performance dropped dramatically, in some cases to near-random levels.</p>
    <p>For users, this creates a maddening dynamic. You know the information is there. You can scroll up and see it. But the model acts as if it does not exist.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Why "Memory" Features Don't Solve This</h2>
    <p>OpenAI has introduced memory features that allow ChatGPT to retain certain facts across conversations. Users understandably assume this fixes the context window problem. It does not.</p>
    <p>The memory feature stores a small number of compressed facts ("the user prefers Python" or "the user's name is Sarah"). These are injected into the beginning of each new conversation as a brief summary. This is useful for basic personalization, but it is fundamentally different from actually remembering your conversation.</p>
    <p>Within a single conversation, the memory feature does nothing at all. The context window problem persists exactly as before. The memory feature is a band-aid on a structural wound.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>System Prompts Eat Your Context</h2>
    <p>Before your conversation even begins, OpenAI injects a system prompt into the context window. This prompt contains behavioral instructions, safety guidelines, and other directives. Depending on the implementation, this can consume anywhere from 500 to several thousand tokens.</p>
    <p>You do not see this text. You do not know how long it is. But it is sitting in your context window, consuming space. By the time you type your first message, the window is already partially full.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Why Bigger Windows Don't Fix the Problem</h2>
    <p>The natural assumption is that bigger context windows solve everything. If 8K tokens is not enough, make it 128K. Some models now advertise windows of 200K tokens or more.</p>
    <p>Bigger windows help at the margins. But the "lost in the middle" effect gets worse as windows grow. Processing cost scales with context length. And users fill bigger windows with longer conversations, until they hit the new limit and experience the exact same cliff-edge failure.</p>
    <p>The problem does not disappear. It just takes longer to appear.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Real-World Impact</h2>
    <p>A developer pastes in a large codebase and asks ChatGPT to refactor a function. The model produces code that conflicts with constraints defined in files that have fallen out of the window. A lawyer feeds a contract into ChatGPT for analysis. The model misses a critical liability clause buried in the middle. An author uses ChatGPT for a novel and the model forgets character traits established early in the conversation.</p>
    <p>In every case, the failure is silent. The model produces output that looks complete, hiding the gaps behind fluent language.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>
    <p><strong>Keep conversations short.</strong> Start new conversations frequently rather than extending a single thread for hours.</p>
    <p><strong>Front-load critical instructions.</strong> Put your most important constraints in your first message, where they get the most attention.</p>
    <p><strong>Repeat key instructions.</strong> If a conversation is getting long and the model is drifting, restate your core requirements.</p>
    <p><strong>Don't trust long-conversation output blindly.</strong> The longer the conversation, the higher the probability the model has lost something important.</p>
    <p><strong>Watch for the signs.</strong> When ChatGPT starts contradicting earlier instructions or asking questions you already answered, it has lost context. Start a new conversation.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>The context window is not a minor technical detail. It is a fundamental constraint that shapes everything about how large language models work and fail.</p>
    <p>OpenAI markets ChatGPT as a conversation partner. The word "conversation" implies continuity, memory, and coherent engagement over time. The context window makes that implication false. What you are having is not a conversation. It is a series of stateless interactions dressed up to look like one, and the seams show whenever the window fills up.</p>
    <p>Understanding this makes you a more effective user of a limited tool. And it makes you a harder target for marketing that promises capabilities the technology cannot deliver.</p>
