        <p>The data is clear. We tested all major AI platforms for writing code. Here's what we found after extensive testing.</p>
        <p>For writing code, Gemini consistently delivered the best results. Copilot came in as a close second, offering some unique advantages depending on specific requirements.</p>
        <p>What really matters here is price matters too. Gemini's premium tier costs more, but the quality improvement over the free version is significant. If you're serious about writing code, the investment is worth it.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: start with Gemini for writing code. It's not perfect, but it's currently the best option available.</p>
