        <h2>Garbage In, Plausible Garbage Out</h2>
        <p>A language model is a statistical summary of its training data. If the data is biased, outdated, or contaminated, the model reproduces those flaws with perfect confidence.</p>
    </div>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Everything the Model Knows Comes From Training Data</h2>
    <p>A language model is a compressed statistical summary of its training data. It has no other source of knowledge. It cannot observe the world. It cannot run experiments. It cannot ask someone. Every response it generates is a recombination of patterns extracted from the text it was trained on.</p>
    <p>This means the quality of the model's output is bounded by the quality of its training data. If the training data is biased, the model is biased. If the training data contains misinformation, the model reproduces misinformation. If the training data is missing information about a topic, the model fills that gap with statistical guesswork.</p>
    <p>Understanding the training data is understanding the model. Everything else is downstream.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Cutoff Problem</h2>
    <p>Training data has a cutoff date. Everything after that date does not exist for the model. This is not like a newspaper being a day old. Training data can be months or years old, and the model gives no indication of when its knowledge ends.</p>
    <p>Ask about a company that went bankrupt after the cutoff and the model will describe it as if it still exists. Ask about a law that was amended and the model will cite the old version. Ask about a scientific finding published after training and the model will either say nothing or confabulate something that sounds plausible.</p>
    <p>The danger is not that the information is old. The danger is that the model presents old information with the same confidence it uses for current information. There is no expiration date on its claims.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>What "Trained on the Internet" Actually Means</h2>
    <p>When companies say their model was "trained on a large corpus of internet text," they are describing a dataset scraped from the web with minimal quality filtering. This includes academic papers, news articles, and technical documentation. It also includes blog posts by amateurs, forum arguments, satirical articles, content farms, and pages that are simply wrong.</p>
    <p>The model does not know which sources are reliable. It does not weight a peer-reviewed paper more heavily than a Reddit comment. Both are text. Both contribute to the statistical patterns the model learns. If Reddit contains more text about a topic than the academic literature, the Reddit version has a stronger statistical signal.</p>
    <p>You are not querying an encyclopedia. You are querying a statistical average of the internet, where popularity determines weight, not accuracy.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Bias Amplification</h2>
    <p>Training data reflects the biases of the people who created it. The internet overrepresents English-speaking, Western, male, and technology-oriented perspectives. Minority viewpoints, non-English sources, and underrepresented communities contribute proportionally less data.</p>
    <p>The model does not correct for this imbalance. It learns it. Ask about a profession and the model's default assumptions about gender, race, and background will reflect the statistical patterns in its training data, which reflect the biases of the internet.</p>
    <p>RLHF and safety fine-tuning attempt to reduce the most obvious biases. But these are surface-level corrections applied to a system with deep statistical biases. The model has learned a biased view of the world. You can instruct it not to express that bias, but you cannot remove the bias from its learned representations.</p>
    <p>This is not about political correctness. It is about accuracy. A model that defaults to biased assumptions will give less accurate answers about anything that deviates from the dominant pattern in its training data.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Copyright Problem</h2>
    <p>Language models are trained on copyrighted text without the authors' consent. This is not a peripheral concern. It is the foundation of the technology. Every novel, every news article, every textbook, every blog post in the training data was used without permission or compensation.</p>
    <p>Courts are currently deciding whether this constitutes fair use. But regardless of the legal outcome, the practical reality is that language models reproduce copyrighted patterns. Ask ChatGPT to write in the style of a specific author and it produces something recognizably similar, because it has ingested that author's work.</p>
    <p>For users, this creates a subtle risk. Content generated by ChatGPT may contain phrases, structures, or ideas that are traceable to copyrighted sources. The model does not flag this. It cannot flag this, because it does not track the provenance of the patterns it has learned.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Synthetic Data Pollution and Model Collapse</h2>
    <p>Since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated text. Blog posts, product reviews, social media comments, news articles, and forum responses are increasingly written by language models. This AI-generated text is now being scraped as training data for the next generation of models.</p>
    <p>Researchers at the University of Oxford studied what happens when language models are trained on output from previous language models. The result is a progressive narrowing of the output distribution. Rare information disappears. Common patterns get over-reinforced. The model becomes more generic, more repetitive, and less capable of producing novel or accurate output.</p>
    <p>They called this "model collapse," and the trajectory is clear: each generation trained on synthetic data is worse than the last. The diversity and richness of human-written text that made early models impressive is being diluted by the bland, homogeneous output of the models themselves.</p>
    <p>This is not a hypothetical concern. It is happening now. The training data for future models will contain a higher proportion of AI-generated text than any previous dataset. The models built on that data will be measurably worse in ways that are difficult to reverse.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>Data Contamination and Benchmark Fraud</h2>
    <p>When a language model scores well on a benchmark, there is a question that is rarely asked: was the benchmark data in the training set? If the model has seen the test questions during training, the score measures memorization, not capability.</p>
    <p>Multiple research teams have found evidence of benchmark contamination in major language models. Test questions, sometimes with answers, appear in the training data. Companies have limited incentive to prevent this, because higher benchmark scores drive adoption and investment.</p>
    <p>This does not mean all benchmark results are fraudulent. But it means that benchmark scores should be treated with the same skepticism you would apply to a student who had access to the answer key.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>The Feedback Loop Nobody Talks About</h2>
    <p>Language models are increasingly used to generate content that people then interact with, share, and discuss. Those interactions generate more text, which becomes future training data. The model shapes the information environment, which shapes future models.</p>
    <p>The result is a shrinking intellectual ecosystem. Ideas that language models generate well get amplified. Ideas that language models handle poorly get underrepresented. Over time, public discourse begins to reflect the statistical biases and limitations of the models, because the models are both consuming and producing an increasing share of the text.</p>
    <p>This is not science fiction. It is the observable trajectory of an internet where a growing percentage of content is machine-generated, machine-consumed, and machine-recycled.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
    <h2>What This Means for Users</h2>
    <p>Every time you use ChatGPT, you are interacting with a distorted mirror of the internet. The mirror is smudged by popularity bias, temporal limitations, copyright infringement, synthetic contamination, and demographic imbalance.</p>
    <p>For well-documented, mainstream topics, the distortion is small and the output is useful. For anything niche, recent, nuanced, culturally specific, or technically precise, the distortion grows. The model fills in what it does not know with what it has seen most often, and what it has seen most often is not always what is true.</p>
    <p>The training data is not the model's fuel. It is the model's worldview. And that worldview has serious, structural blind spots that no amount of prompting can overcome.</p>
