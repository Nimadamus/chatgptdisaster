        <p>Here's what the tech press isn't telling you.</p>
<p>AI can pattern-match at superhuman speed. What it can't do is understand context, exercise judgment, or take responsibility for its outputs. Those are still exclusively human capabilities.</p>
<p>The limitations of current AI aren't being solved by more parameters or more training data. The fundamental architecture has ceiling that no amount of scale will break through.</p>
<p>When an AI system fails, there's no accountability. The company blames the user. The user blames the tool. And the actual harm falls on whoever trusted the output.</p>
<p>The bottom line: approach AI claims with healthy skepticism. The technology has real uses, but it's not the magic solution the industry wants you to believe.</p>
